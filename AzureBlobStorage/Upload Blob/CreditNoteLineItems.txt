Credit notes and line items Started by Alex Bergin - 6 Sep 2016 in API Endpoints As per the GET request doc's for Credit Notes, Credit Notes don't include the Credit Note Line items.

For Invoices they don't include Line Items unless you also include the optional 'page' parameter, however Credit Note's don't have the 'page' parameter.

It seems the only way to get Line Items of Credit Notes is to individually query each Credit Note by passing the CreditNoteID value. This could take a while given the slow performance of the Xero APi servers, and would eat into our daily 1000 requests limit.

Have I overlooked something or is there another way to get CreditItems with Lineitems. Thanks.
